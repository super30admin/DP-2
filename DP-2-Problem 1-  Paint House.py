256. Paint House


Time Complexity : O(N)
 

Space Complexity : O(1)



Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes


we are starting from the last row and going upwards by :
    
    Here the loo is starting from the second last row
    
    As the conditions states :
        - You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
         - costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with the color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green,
         
    3 conditions for:
        Red selecting min for (blue, green ) of Next row below + current cost
        Green selecting min for (blue, red ) of Next row below + current cost
        Blue selecting min for (red, green ) of Next row below + current cost
        
    At the end themin for top row is calculated to get the minimum cost
