2D matrix is used to store the number of coins based on the amount chnages
the column represent the amount from 0
and the row consist of the different coins

The value of a particular cell is calculated as follows:
    
For the value of Jth column and ith row 
  untill j < coins[i-1] : dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] the value from above row
    else:
       the addition of the of above value and the value 1 + dp[i][j- coins[i-1]]
       
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][ j - coins[i-1]]
