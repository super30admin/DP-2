# DP-2

## Problem1(https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/)
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

## Problem2 (https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2/)
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

Example 1:

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:

5=5

5=2+2+1

5=2+1+1+1

5=1+1+1+1+1
Example 2:

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
Example 3:

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
Note:

You can assume that

0 <= amount <= 5000
1 <= coin <= 5000
the number of coins is less than 500
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer
