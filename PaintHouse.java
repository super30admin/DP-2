/**
 * Find the min. cost => think greedily i.e. paint the house with a color
 * associated to the min cost for this house
 * 
 * eg: [[17, 2, 17], [16, 16, 5], [14, 3, 19]]
 * row 0 => min == color 1 == 2
 * row 1 => min == color 2 == 5
 * row 2 => min == color 1 == 3
 * 
 * min cost = 2 + 5 + 3 = 10
 * hence, greedy passes.
 * 
 * eg: [[17, 2, 17], [16, 5, 16], [14, 3, 19]]
 * row 0 => min == color 1 == 2
 * row 1 => min == color 1 == 5 => but we can't pick this color as it has
 * already been used by the previous (or adjacent) house
 * we should choose any other color not the smallest as per the painting
 * constraint
 * 
 * hence, greedy fails.
 * 
 * 
 * If Greedy fails ==> try all possible combos == RECURSION (top-down)
 * TRY painting each house with all the colors (except the previously painted
 * house's color) --> go to the next house
 * 
 * Draw the recursive tree
 * 
 * such that at each step the problem boils down to find min cost to paint a
 * house, given previous house's color (as no 2 adjacent houses should have the
 * same color) == RECURRENCE RELATION
 * 
 * for each house, we have 3 colors to pick from (except the previous color) ==
 * LOGIC
 * 
 * we continue, till all houses are painted == BASE CASE
 * 
 * hence, TC: exponential
 * SC: stack space i.e. # of houses == O(n)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * WE find that the recursive tree has overlapping subproblems => DP
 * (MEMOIZATION)
 * 
 * we've 2 changing params, house (to be painted) and the prevColor (previously
 * painted house's color)
 * 
 * hence, use a 2D dp
 * # of rows == param 1 == # of houses
 * # of columns == param 2 == # of colors
 * NOTE: for the 1st house to be painted, we've 3 possible ways, hence prev
 * color = 3
 * therefore, dp[n][4]
 * 
 * TC: O(n * 4)
 * SC: O(n) + O(n * 4) == stack + dp array
 * 
 * 
 * Ovecome the stack space, by avoiding recursion, i.e., TABULATION (bottom-up)
 * 
 * don't think, just replicate the recurrence
 * move from the base case (of recursion) to the start call
 * 
 * return the start call of recursion as ans == dp[n-1][3]
 * 
 * TC: O(n * 4)
 * SC: O(n * 4)
 * 
 * 
 * Space Optimization == as at each step we're interested only in the previous
 * house, the other computed houses don't matter, so why to store ?
 * TC: O(n * 4)
 * SC: O(1)
