/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/
 * 
 *Given a row of n houses, each house can be coloured with any of the three colours: let these be red blue or green. 
 *the cost for painting a particular house with a particular colour is going to be different. you have to colour the house
 * in such a way that no two adjacent houses will have the same colour. the cost for painting  a house with any colour is 
 * represented by a n X 3 cost matrix where cost for painting house 0 with colour red is cost[0][0] and cost for 
 * painting house 4 with green colour is cost[4][2] and so on.....calculate the minimum cost to paint all houses. 
 * try to optimize it for space !!
